Steps for email verification 

1. We will use the Flask-mail library for this and will add our mail username and password to the file.
2. Then, we will generate a unique verification token in the registration route in the flask file.
3. We can then use a mail server to send emails with a verification link using a function in the app.py file.
4. Then, add a verify route to ensure the verification. When the user clicks on the verification link, it will validate the token and mark the user's email as verified in the database.
5. Now, only the verified email users have access to log in.


Steps for password reset

1. Firstly, we would have to create a new page for forgot passwords to get the user's email.
2. Then, we will create a unique token and send it to the user's email.
3. We will also have to create a new reset password page. This page link will be in the sent mail. Then, we will verify the token. If the token is valid, the user can reset the password.
